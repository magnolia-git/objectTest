The music track in this application, "Yellow invitation," **is _NOT_ the full song!** It's merely a sample since I could get in trouble for having the full track uploaded here. :persevere:

Things to implement:

- Song selection!
- A user-friendly beat mapper for people to put their own songs in (eventually? maybe?)
- Mad Rat!
- More animated graphics
